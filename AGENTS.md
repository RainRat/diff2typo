# AGENTS

## Scope
This file applies to the entire repository.

## General guidelines
- Update or add unit tests alongside code changes when behaviour changes.
- Do not write in user-facing docs that a feature is "new", or write in code comments that a method uses a "new way". Such references become obsolete. Remove them if seen.

## Testing
- Run `pytest` from the repository root before submitting changes.
